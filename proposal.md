Step it UP!

## Decription
Fun typical rythm game where the player must hit the arrows correlating to the visuals on screen. It relates to media and digital art by being a form of entertainment media through the graphics of digital arts.
## Features
Feature 1: Main feature will need to be the display where there will be randomly generated (or pre-generated based on if I wish to include music) arrow directions that travel down to the bottom of the screen.

Feature 2: User input and matching the arrows shown on screen. Here the feature will need to prioritize a specific key bind that will utilize Classes to organize their function and association. As the arrows travel past a line indicated on the screen or maybe some kind of highlighted space the player will need to hit the correcponding keys.

Feature 3: Point generator and possible multiplier. Here I will need to decide about including a multiplier for getting a certain ammount of arrows in a row.

Feature 4: If the player fails to get arrows a certain ammount of times the game will prompt a "You Lost" feature where it will ask the player if they wish to try again.

## Challenges
Some of the new skills of features I will need to learn for this project

Challenge 1: Drawing and displaying out the arrow keys and randomly generating them on the display screen. A lot of this process will need to take influence from the screen saver lab but also other labs with the draw features. Utilizing the class features will make this a lot easier when organizing the drawing of the symbols and then making definitions that will do the functions of the "trails" or just animating them scrolling down.

Challenge 2: I will need to learn how to use player input that isnt from the terminal and instead works with the pop up window display. Unlike most of our user input labs I need the arrow key inputs to work in real time without a enter key being utilized.

Challenge 3: Creating a multiplier, this might not be as difficult if once i have the correlation of correct inputs with the timing of the keys i can use many of the + 1 point if statements to add points to the players count, and also using the mathmatical python elements to add score boosts like we did in the character inventory labs.

Challenge 4: Similarly finding a way to keep score of the ammount of miss inputs to know when the player should quit the game and popping up a end screen. This could also use the if statements to track the players ammounts of missed inputs however I'm also thinking there could be a way where if a character reaches a certain negative score that they would be kicked off and tried again. Or i could create a life system where the user on screen can see how many mistakes they have left. 

Other challenges to be determined.

## Outcomes

My ideal outcome with this project is to make a smooth easy going game that both challenges the player but also provides entertainment. I outcome I would like to see is to also make the game visually appealing with my own use of colors and display but the main game function is the most important part.

The bare essentials I want is I need the arrow keys that indicate what need to be pressed to appear on screen and be randomized for the player, and for the player to be able to input the correct keys and it score points. 

## Milestones

Week 1 Goal:
-Conduct research on possible python features that could simplify the process a bit
-Start of the display of the function

Week 2 Goal:
-Start creating the class function of the keys and be able to travel down the screen randomly
-Create the user input function

Week 3
-Create the multiplier and points function, win and lose function!
-Create any polishing and clean up the code
